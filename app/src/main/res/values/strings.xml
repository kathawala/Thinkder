    <string name="title_activity_first_thinker">Hermann Hesse</string>
    <string name="hesse_stats">Hermann Hesse\n(1877-1962)</string>
    <string name="hesse_most">Works\n\nSiddhartha  (1922)\nSteppenwolf  (1927)\nThe Glass Bead Game  (1943)</string>
    <string name="hesse_more">A prized author from 1920s Germany and a 1960s United States counterculture icon would be a strange way to describe any author other than Hermann Hesse. The loss of moral and spiritual fiber that Hesse perceived in the world around him after World War I survived past his years and was made popular again in the wake of the 1960s counterculture movement in the US. His novels sharply focus on the <b>search for meaning in life</b> and its opposition to the goals of modern society.</string>
    <string name="hesse_quote">"“Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours.”"</string>

    <string name="butler_stats">Judith Butler\n(1956-Present)\n</string>
    <string name="butler_most">Works\n\nGender Trouble  (1990)\nImitation and Gender Insubordination  (1990)</string>
    <string name="butler_more">Butler\'s big idea is that behaviors seen as masculine or feminine aren\'t based on anything "natural". Sure there are biological differences, but genders only act in certain ways because of stereotypes that are repeated so often that they worm their way into cultural consciousness. Women don\'t have to wear lipstick; men don\'t have to like watching wrestling; we\'re just used to thinking that because we see it so often. And when people "perform" the acts that fit those assumptions, they produce what\'s seen as the reality of how people "are" (the ontology).</string>
    <string name="butler_quote">"“That the gendered body is performative suggests that it has no ontological status apart from the various acts which constitute its reality.”"</string>
    <string name="nietzsche_stats">Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844-1900)\n</string>
    <string name="nietzsche_most">Works\n\nHuman, All Too Human  (1878)\nThus Spoke Zarathustra  (1885)\nBeyond Good and Evil  (1886)\nEcce Homo  (1908)</string>
    <string name="nietzsche_more">Nietzsche\'s fame and influence spanned across the fields of study from psychoanalysis to art to philosophy. His rejection of absolute truths, condemnation of all types of morality, and strict pessimism regarding the meaning of life are all part of what is now known as <b>nihilism</b>. His brand of nihilism is most famously known for its conclusion that each individual should have the courage to develop his own good and evil, independent of the society around him, and listen to nothing else.</string>
    <string name="nietzsche_quote">"“Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.”"</string>

The Cambridge Companion to Oscar Wilde (Cambridge University Press, 1997)</string>
    <string name="wilde_more">This statement exemplifies Wilde’s belief in “art for art’s sake,” that is in the fact that art – here, literature – does not have to serve any moral purpose and cannot be judged by that standard. The quote can be read both as Wilde’s direct response to his critics, and expression of Wilde’s overall aesthetic philosophy. Instead of measuring and judging literature against black-and-white “moral” or “immoral” standards, Wilde suggests, books have to be evaluated by different, wholly literary, standards, i.e. by looking at their performance and brilliance in terms of style and overall aesthetics: are they “well written,” or “badly written”</string>
    <string name="wilde_quote">"“There is no such thing as moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.”"</string>

    <string name="zhuangzi_most">The Zhuangzi</string>
    <string name="zhuangzi_more">This is one of Zhuangzi\'s most well known quotes -- the butterfly dream, as many call it. Zhuangzi was steeped in ideas of Taoism, which deeply influenced his philosophical ideas. He believed that the pinnacle of enlightenment is very much is when a person becomes unbounded, like a butterfly, floating freely, being one with heaven, and not with emotional or material attachments to the earth. To transform to that point, from a larva all the way to a a butterfly, takes much time and effort -- meditation, accumulation of knowledge, rooting yourself in heaven. This quote has also sparked much discussion about point of view, perspectives, varying levels of consciousness, and their effects on the human condition.</string>
    <string name="zhuangzi_quote">""Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, a veritable butterfly, enjoying itself to the full of its bent, and not knowing it was Chuang Chou. Suddenly I awoke, and came to myself, the veritable Chuang Chou. Now I do not know whether it was then I dreamt I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man. Between me and the butterfly there must be a difference. This is an instance of transformation.""</string>

    <string name="socrates_more">The Socratic problem is a rat\'s nest of complexities arising from the fact that various people wrote about Socrates whose accounts differ in crucial respects, leaving us to wonder which, if any, are accurate representations of the historical Socrates. Socratic Method is a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas. Destroying the illusion that we already comprehend the world perfectly and honestly accepting the fact of our own ignorance, Socrates believed, are vital steps toward our acquisition of genuine knowledge, by discovering universal definitions of the key concepts governing human life.</string>
