    <string name="hesse_more">A prized author from 1920s Germany and a 1960s United States counterculture icon would be a strange way to describe any author other than Hermann Hesse. The loss of moral and spiritual fiber that Hesse perceived in the world around him after World War I survived past his years and was made popular again in the wake of the 1960s counterculture movement in the US. His novels sharply focus on the search for meaning in life and its opposition to the goals of modern society.</string>
